        "\n",
        "1. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**: The foundation of deep learning, ANNs are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. They consist of interconnected units (neurons) that process information using a connectionist approach to computation.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - **Input Layer**: The layer that receives the initial data.\n",
        "   - **Hidden Layers**: Layers between input and output layers where the actual processing through weighted connections happens. Deep learning networks have multiple hidden layers.\n",
        "   - **Output Layer**: The final layer that outputs the result of the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)**: ANNs with multiple hidden layers. These are the core of deep learning, allowing the model to learn and represent data with multiple levels of abstraction.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. **Training**: The process of learning the weights of the connections in the neural network. This is typically done using a method called backpropagation in conjunction with an optimization algorithm like stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Loss Functions**: Functions that measure the difference between the predicted output and the actual output during training. Common loss functions include mean squared error for regression tasks and cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.\n",

        "2. **Forward Propagation**:\n",
        "   - Input data is fed into the input layer.\n",
        "   - The data passes through the hidden layers, where each neuron computes a weighted sum of its inputs, adds a bias, and applies an activation function.\n",
        "   - The processed information moves through the network, ultimately reaching the output layer, which produces the network's prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Loss Calculation**: The output is compared to the true value using a loss function. The loss function quantifies the difference between the predicted output and the actual target.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Backward Propagation (Backpropagation)**:\n",
        "   - The network calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by applying the chain rule.\n",
        "   - The weights are updated in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the loss. This step is often performed using optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n",
