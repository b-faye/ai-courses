        "**TensorFlow 2.0** is a major update to Google's open-source machine learning library, TensorFlow. It simplifies and streamlines the experience of building and deploying machine learning models, offering several key improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Eager Execution by Default**: TensorFlow 2.0 uses eager execution as the default mode, which makes operations more intuitive and debugging easier by providing immediate feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Simplified API**: The API is more user-friendly with a focus on intuitive high-level APIs. Functions and classes are organized to make it easier to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.\n",

        "- **Improved Performance**: TensorFlow 2.0 comes with performance optimizations and better support for various hardware accelerators.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Unified API**: TensorFlow 2.0 unifies APIs for different tasks, like training and serving models, making it easier to switch between different stages of the ML pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Support for TensorFlow Hub and TensorFlow Datasets**: Enhanced support for reusable models and standardized datasets.\n",
        "\n",
